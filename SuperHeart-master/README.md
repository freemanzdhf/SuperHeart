There are no know bugs. 

What we did and didn't accomplish:
We chose not to do blessings and curses and instead decided to implement different types of arrows. We had a standard arrow, a shotgun arrow, a sniper arrow, and a ricochet arrow. We also did not include a menu as we did not see much point in it. We had originalloy planned to have 20 different levels. However, we only created 10 because there was not much point in making more. Apart from that, we pretty much stuck to our plan. We included a lot of interesting ideas in our design so we always had something planned out to do.
